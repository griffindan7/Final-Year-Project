## Guide to Running the Project

-Create a folder called 'project', then move all these files into that folder.
-cd into that folder in terminal, when running my project I used terminal in VSCode.
-I think then if you run 'npx expo run:android' it should run the app.
-You will need an Android device connected via USB or an emulator with SDK 28 I think.

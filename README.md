# Final Year Project
 FYP Upload

## Guide to Running the Project

-Create a folder called 'project', then move all these files into that folder.   
-cd into that folder in terminal, when running my project I used terminal in VSCode.   
-I think then if you run 'npx expo run:android' it should run the app.   
-You will need an Android device connected via USB or an emulator installed.   

-There might be issues with 'node_modules' as I had to delete these in order to upload to GitHub, but running 'npm install' should redownload them all.   
-If theres any issues send me an email.

-As for description of the files, the files I used and edited were the files in the screen folder and the app.js folder.
